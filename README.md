# Yelp_Recommendations
Final project for DATA 515 Software Design for Data Science course at University of Washington

<h3><i> Introduction </i></h3>
With the accelerating pace of life and the surge in demand for healthy lifestyles, more and more people have a need for nearby healthy restaurants. However, few tools incorporate this dimension into restaurant searches. The goal of our project is to provide a way for users to discover healthy restaurants within the existing Yelp directory. Using Yelp data, our platform will provide restaurant health ratings to eaters based on the results of our machine learning model. The relevant  data in our project consists of business data and photo metadata, including captions. We will apply Natural Language Processing, Text Classification, and Machine Learning techniques  to analyze the descriptive text in the captions of food photos to determine whether the food is healthy or not.
